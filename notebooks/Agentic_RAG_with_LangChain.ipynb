    "Earlier we used this phrasing:\n",
    "\n",
    "`coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications`\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We initialize our state object:\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : []}`\n",
    "2. Our user submits a query to our application.\n",
    "  - New State: `HumanMessage(#1)`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1)}`\n",
    "3. We pass our state object to an Agent node which is able to read the current state. It will use the last `HumanMessage` as input. It gets some kind of output which it will add to the state.\n",
    "  - New State: `AgentMessage(#1, additional_kwargs {\"function_call\" : \"WebSearchTool\"})`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1), AgentMessage(#1, ...)]}`\n",

       "  FunctionMessage(content=\"Published: 2024-06-19\\nTitle: R^2AG: Incorporating Retrieval Information into Retrieval Augmented Generation\\nAuthors: Fuda Ye, Shuangyin Li, Yongqi Zhang, Lei Chen\\nSummary: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has been applied in many scenarios to\\naugment large language models (LLMs) with external documents provided by\\nretrievers. However, a semantic gap exists between LLMs and retrievers due to\\ndifferences in their training objectives and architectures. This misalignment\\nforces LLMs to passively accept the documents provided by the retrievers,\\nleading to incomprehension in the generation process, where the LLMs are\\nburdened with the task of distinguishing these documents using their inherent\\nknowledge. This paper proposes R$^2$AG, a novel enhanced RAG framework to fill\\nthis gap by incorporating Retrieval information into Retrieval Augmented\\nGeneration. Specifically, R$^2$AG utilizes the nuanced features from the\\nretrievers and employs a R$^2$-Former to capture retrieval information. Then, a\\nretrieval-aware prompting strategy is designed to integrate retrieval\\ninformation into LLMs' generation. Notably, R$^2$AG suits low-source scenarios\\nwhere LLMs and retrievers are frozen. Extensive experiments across five\\ndatasets validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of R$^2$AG. Our\\nanalysis reveals that retrieval information serves as an anchor to aid LLMs in\\nthe generation process, thereby filling the semantic gap.\\n\\nPublished: 2022-02-13\\nTitle: A Survey on Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation\\nAuthors: Huayang Li, Yixuan Su, Deng Cai, Yan Wang, Lemao Liu\\nSummary: Recently, retrieval-augmented text generation attracted increasing attention\\nof the computational linguistics community. Compared with conventional\\ngeneration models, retrieval-augmented text generation has remarkable\\nadvantages and particularly has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many\\nNLP tasks. This paper aims to conduct a survey about retrieval-augmented text\\ngeneration. It firstly highlights the generic paradigm of retrieval-augmented\\ngeneration, and then it reviews notable approaches according to different tasks\\nincluding dialogue response generation, machine translation, and other\\ngeneration tasks. Finally, it points out some important directions on top of\\nrecent methods to facilitate future research.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-07-04\\nTitle: Meta-prompting Optimized Retrieval-augmented Generation\\nAuthors: João Rodrigues, António Branco\\nSummary: Retrieval-augmented generation resorts to content retrieved from external\\nsources in order to leverage the performance of large language models in\\ndownstream tasks. The excessive volume of retrieved content, the possible\\ndispersion of its parts, or their out of focus range may happen nevertheless to\\neventually have a detrimental rather than an incremental effect. To mitigate\\nthis issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to\\nrefine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting\\nto meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding\\nmulti-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation\\nresults indicate that this method outperforms a similar retrieval-augmented\\nsystem but without this method by over 30%.\", name='arxiv'),\n",
